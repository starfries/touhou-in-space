Reimu -
	Additude towards Yukari -
		Puts up with her. She's so mysterious, she doesn't much care for it.
		Suika -
			Puts up with her. She's a free-loader, but Reimu's too lazy to deal with it.
Yukari -
	Additude towards Reimu -
		Friendly, mysterious, and the one who sent Reimu on the task in the first place.
Suika -
	Additude towards Reimu -
		Friendly. Pokes at exploding the moon again, too.
Marisa -
	Additude towards Nitori -
		Friendly and cheerful, in high spirits even, which is rare for Marisa.
		Aya -
			Carefree and aloof.
Nitori -
	Additude towards Marisa -
		Facts, info, whatnot. Curiosity, intrigue, the like. A tad shy, but can be rather cheerful.
Aya -
	Additude towards Marisa -
		She's really just there for the scoops. She tries to keep a calmer and quieter
		additude when talking to Marisa though.
Sakuya -
	Additude towards Patchy -
		Kind and affectionate, but tries to keep it secretive. Otherwise, typically calm and collected.
		Eirin -
			Same as Eirin's, minus the hinting at mysterious reasons.
Patchy -
	Additude towards Sakuya -
		Mostly pointing out info and deducing stuff. Can be sarcastic and condescending.
Eirin -
	Additude towards Sakuya -
		A tad surprised, and a tad suspicious. Hints at the mysterious reason she's surprised towards Sakuya in IN
		a few times. (Possible reason: Sakuya's a Lunarian.)
